Step 1: The first action to do, is to provide login credentials to log into the Orchestrator, receiving back an "authentication token" that represents the session, for use in the subsequent REST API calls.

Procedure:
	- Select "POST"
	- Use URL https://<MSO_ip_add>:<port>/api/v1/auth/login
	- Select Body, raw, and then select JSON
	- Use the following script for the credentials 
  
Code:

{
    "userName": "<username>",
    "userPasswd": "<password>",
    "domain": "<domain>"
}
	- Click on Send Button
	
- The authentication token will be reflected in the below "Pretty" section.

Note: Use the authentication token before get expires. The default timer is 20 minutes

Step 2: Use the above token on authentication for an API call that gets the schema details.

Procedure:
	- Open a new TAB and select "Get"
	- Use URL https://<MSO_ip_add>/api/v1/schemas
	- Select Header, Write, and Select Authorization in the KEY section
	- Under the Value section write Bearer and past the previously copied token
	- Click on Send Button
	
Step 3: Use the above schema ID to "Get" the configuration script for further modification.

Procedure:
	- Open a new TAB and select "Get"
	- Use URL https://<nd-node-ip>/mso/api/v1/schemas/<ID of chosen schema
	- Select Header, Write, and Select Authorization in the KEY section
	- Under the Value section write Bearer and past the previously copied token
	- Select Body, raw, and then select JSON
	- Click on Send Button

Step 4: In this final Step we will use input method to push script

Procedure:
	- Open a new TAB and select "Input"
	- Use URL https://<nd-node-ip>/mso/api/v1/schemas/<ID of chosen schema
	- Select Header, Write, and Select Authorization in the KEY section
	- Under the Value section write Bearer and past the previously copied token
	- Select Body, raw, and then select JSON
	- In the payload paste a modified script
	- Click on Send Button
	- Verify that the Status code is “200 OK”
